# BattleShipGAME
BattleShipGAME is a console-based implementation of the classic board game Battleship. In the game, players take turns trying to sink the other player's ships by guessing their coordinates on a 10x10 grid. The first player to sink all of their opponent's ships wins the game.

## Game Modes
The game offers two different game modes: one player and two players. In one player mode, the player plays against a computer-controlled opponent. In two player mode, two players take turns trying to sink each other's ships.

## Deploying Ships
Before the game begins, players must deploy their ships on their respective boards. Players can choose to deploy their Carrier (1 place), Battleship (2 places), Cruiser (3 places), Submarine (4 places), and Destroyer (5 places) in any orientation they choose on the board.

## Making Moves
During their turn, players must select an x and y coordinate on their opponent's board to attack. If the chosen coordinates contain a ship, it is considered a "hit". If the coordinates are empty, it is considered a "miss". Players must continue taking turns until one of them sinks all of their opponent's ships.

## Math Questions
As an additional challenge, players must answer a math problem correctly in order to make a move. The difficulty of the math problem is based on the player's current score. This adds an element of strategy to the game, as players must decide whether to try to sink their opponent's ships quickly or take more time to answer the math problems and potentially score more points.

## Score Tracking
As the game progresses, players' scores are tracked and displayed on the screen. Players earn points for sinking their opponent's ships and for correctly answering math problems. The game keeps track of the total number of hits and misses for each player, as well as their current score.


Some of the cool features of this game include:

- The ability to play against an AI opponent
- A score counter that keeps track of the number of hits each player has made
- A list of previous hits and misses to help players strategize their next moves
- A "question" feature that asks players a math problem before their turn, which they must solve correctly in order to proceed

Overall, this game provides a fun and challenging way for players to test their naval warfare skills.
